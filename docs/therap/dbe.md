Briefly explain ACID properties
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

ACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties are

- **Atomicity:** Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.
- **Consistency:** Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transaction
- **Isolation:** Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.
- **Durability:** The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Atomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]
