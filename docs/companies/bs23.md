In a bag , there is black and red balls. The ratio of black to red is 3:7 , if we add 20 more black balls to the bag then the ratio becomes 1:2. How many red balls are there?
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

Let the number of black balls be 3x and the number of red balls be 7x. After adding 20 more black balls, the ratio becomes 1:2. So, the number of black balls is 3x + 20 and the number of red balls is 7x. According to the given condition, (3x + 20) / 7x = 1 / 2. Solving this equation, we get x = 40. Therefore, the number of red balls is 7x = 280.

which of the following is false about RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)?

- RDBMS supports concurrency control to handle multiple transactions simultaneously.
- RDBMS uses tables to store data in rows and columns.
- In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column.
- RDBMS ensures data integrity using ACID properties.
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

The false statement about RDBMS is: `In RDBMS, a unique constraint prevents null values in a column.` A unique constraint ensures that all values in a column are unique, but it does not prevent null values.

A train leaves station A at 7 AM with the speed of 60 kmph, and another train leaves the A station at 8 AM with the speed of 90 kmph..when will the second train catch the first train?
<details><summery>Show Answer</summery>

The first train is already 60 km ahead and the second train is faster, so we calculate the relative speed:
Relative Speed = Speed of Second Train − Speed of First Train = 90km/h − 60km/h = 30km/h
Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 60km / 30km/h ​= 2hours
Final answer = 8:00AM + 2hours = 10:00AM
The second train will catch the first train at 10 AM

What will be the output of the following code?

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int sum = 7 + 6 / 3 + 14 * 2;
    printf("%d", sum);
    return 0;
}
```
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

Division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition. So, the expression will be evaluated as `7 + 2 + 28 = 37`

What does the `static` keyword mean when used with a method?  
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

When the `static` keyword is used with a method, it means that the method belongs to the class itself rather than an instance of the class. Static methods can be called without creating an instance of the class.  
When we declare a field static, exactly a single copy of that field is created and shared among all instances of that class. Similar to static fields, static methods also belong to a class instead of an object. So, we can invoke them without instantiating the class.

There are 100 light bulbs and 100 people. Initially, all bulbs are off. Person 1 flips every bulb `(1, 2, 3, 4, …)`. Person 2 flips every 2nd bulb `(2, 4, 6, …)`. Person 3 flips every 3rd bulb `(3, 6, 9, …)`, and so on, until all 100 people have acted. How many people would have flipped bulb number 72?
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

We need to find the factors of 72 to determine how many people would have flipped bulb number 72. The factors of 72 are `1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72`. Therefore, 12 people would have flipped bulb number 72.

You are given the head of a circular singly linked list and an integer `n`. How would you remove the `n`th node from the end of the list efficiently? 
<details><summary>Show Hint</summary>
Use the two-pointer technique.
</details>
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

Use two pointer; fast and slow. Move the fast pointer n steps ahead, then move both fast and slow until fast reaches the last node. Delete slow->next by updating slow->next = slow->next->next. Handle edge cases separately.

You are working with a binary search tree (BST) and need to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes, `u` and `v`. Which of the following is the most efficient approach for finding the LCA in a BST, assuming no additional balancing is applied?  
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

The most efficient approach is to traverse the BST from the root, moving left if both u and v are smaller, right if both are larger, and stopping when the current node is between u and v (i.e., the LCA). Time Complexity: O(h), where h is the tree height. Provided the tree is balanced, the height is `log(n)`.

## Day long Assessment Test
Candidates need to stay in the office from morning to evening. They are presented with multiple tasks throughout the day. Most important of them are
1. **Written Exam**
1. **Project Planning and Presentation**
1. **Interview**

### Written Exam
The written exam have 3 segments
1. Behavioural Test
1. Aptitude Test
1. Technical Test

It is taken first thing in the morning. Some of them are taken in sheet of papers and some are taken in external or internal websites.
#### Behavioural Test
The behavioural tests are quite similar to the ones standardized by Amazon. The situational judgment test (SJT) or behavioral assessment stage evaluates a candidate's decision-making and problem-solving skills in workplace scenarios. Candidates are presented with a situation and two possible responses, selecting their preference on a scale from strongly favoring one option to neutral or favoring the other. This helps employers assess traits like leadership, teamwork, and customer focus. Companies like Amazon use this method to identify candidates who align with their core values and work culture.

Diamond Problem is a problem faced during Multiple Inheritance in Java. This problem occurs when a class inherits from two interfaces that both extend a common interface and define a method with the same name. The ambiguity arises because the class implementing these interfaces does not know which method to call when invoking the method by name.

Does Java support multiple inheritence?
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the "diamond problem," where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.

How does Java tackle the multiple inheritence issue?
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the "diamond problem," where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods. 

To resolve this ambiguity, you must override the conflicting method in the implementing class and explicitly specify which method you want to use.

```java
interface A {
    default void foo() {
        System.out.println("A's foo");
    }
}

interface B extends A {
    default void foo() {
        System.out.println("B's foo");
    }
}

interface C extends A {
    default void foo() {
        System.out.println("C's foo");
    }
}

class D implements B, C {
    @Override
    public void foo() {
        B.super.foo(); // or C.super.foo();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        D d = new D();
        d.foo();
    }
}
```
In this example, the foo method is overridden in class D, and within the overridden method, we explicitly call the foomethod from either B or C using B.super.foo() or C.super.foo().

Describe ACID in RDBMS
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

ACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties are

- **Atomicity:** Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.
- **Consistency:** Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transaction
- **Isolation:** Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.
- **Durability:** The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Atomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]
