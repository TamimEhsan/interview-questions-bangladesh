## Star Coder Interview Stages

Star Coder is an annual recruitment test for BS23. The program has 5 stages

1. **Online MCQ Exam:** Everyone who applies for the program will be given the opportunity to sit for this round.  Questions are asked from computer science subjects. The topics generally cover programming, data-algo, OOP, databases, etc. Those who do well in this exam are shortlisted for the next step. 

1. **Onsite Exam:** This round is onsite, a 2-3 hour written exam. Candidates have to take an online exam on problem solving, data algorithms, databases, etc. No internet access is given for this stage. 

1. **Day long Assessment Test:** This is an interesting round. There are various events throughout the day. Teamwork, idea generation, fun, etc. It is a lot like a hackathon. Presentations have to be given. It takes place in their office from morning to evening. Candidates are given a scenario and some questions. They have to come up with a solution and present it. The submissions are ERD, wireframe, SQL etc. 

1. **Technical Interview:** Candidates may be interviewed about the project they developed in Step 3. They may also be asked about problem solving and computer science fundamentals

1. **HR Interview**

Given a number `n`, write a program to find if the number is an armstrong number or not.

An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. For example, `153` is an Armstrong number because `1^3+5^3+3^3=153`

## Day long Assessment Test
Candidates need to stay in the office from morning to evening. They are presented with multiple tasks throughout the day. 

One of the tasks is to come up with a solution for a given scenario. The candidates are divided into groups and each group is assigned a mentor. The mentor will guide the group throughout the day. The groups need to present their solution at the end of the day. The presentation includes ERD, wireframe, SQL etc. Each one of the group members needs to present a part of the solution. 

Candidates are also given a list of framework and language to chose from. A small interview is taken based on the chosen framework and language. The interview is a mixture of technical and HR questions.

## Project Submission
This round is not present in the Star Coder program every year. But in some years, candidates are asked to submit a project. A scenario is given to the candidates through email. The project is chosen based on the candidates preferences presented in the previous rounds. The project is to be submitted within a week. The projects given are pretty basic, but the candidates are expected to follow best practices.

A sample project scenario is given below:
