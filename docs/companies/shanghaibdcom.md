## Questions

### Written Test, Time 2 hrs
#### C Programming 
- pointer, memory, sizeof, struct, define, enum, string, unsigned char/int, short int, array output tracing type problems (search on google, you may find tons of output tracing problems), 1’s/2’s complement, sign magnitude, arithmetic/logical shift
- Size of a struct.
- Pointer to a struct, incrementing the pointer
- Output tracing with various conditional operators

#### OS [basic ‘why’ questions (like, why scheduling)]
- What led to process scheduling.
- When a program file is turned to an executable file, what happens during that time? Linking, assembling, preprocessing, compiling
- Terminology: DMA, Byte Order, coroutine, RISC, PCB
- Parts of a CPU

There are `N` train coaches numbered from `1` to `N` placed in sequence on a left track. The coaches can be moved either directly to the right track or temporarily to a spur track (which behaves like a stack). Once a coach moves from the left track to either the spur or the right, it cannot return to the left.  
Print all possible valid output sequences (permutations) in which the coaches can arrive at the right track using the spur as intermediate storage.

You are given `1000` identical-looking bottles of pills. One of them contains poisonous pills, and all the others are safe. The poison bottle has pills that are 1 gram lighter than the normal 10-gram pills.  
Using a weighing scale only once, how can you identify the poisonous bottle?

Four people need to cross a bridge at night. They have one torch and the bridge can only hold two people at a time. Each person walks at a different speed: `1`, `2`, `5`, and `10` minutes. If two people cross together, they must go at the slower person’s pace.  
What is the minimum total time required for all four people to cross the bridge?
</article>

<article>

You are given two candles of equal length. Each candle takes exactly 60 minutes to burn, but they burn at inconsistent rates (i.e., half the candle may not burn in 30 minutes).  
How can you measure exactly 45 minutes using these two candles?
</article>

<article>

There are `8` jars of pills. One jar contains pills that weigh `9` grams each, while the others contain pills weighing `10` grams each. Using a weighing scale only once, how can you determine which jar contains the lighter pills?

#### DSA: 
<article>

You are given an arithmetic expression in either infix or postfix notation.  
Write a program to convert it to prefix notation, maintaining correct operator precedence and associativity.
</article>

<article>

You are given `1000` unsorted numbers and need to find the `10` smallest elements efficiently.  
Which sorting or selection algorithm would be most optimal to solve this problem and why?
</article>

<article>

Implement a function to perform preorder traversal of a binary tree using both recursive and iterative (loop-based) approaches.
</article>

<article>

Write a program to add and delete a node in a doubly linked list. Your implementation should handle edge cases like deleting the head or tail nodes and adding a node at arbitrary positions.
</article>

<article>

Compare arrays and linked lists in terms of memory usage, access time, insertion, and deletion. In which scenarios would you prefer one over the other?
</article>

<article>

You are given unlimited coins of denominations `1`, `2`, and `5` cents.  
How many different ways can you make a total of `1` dollar (`100` cents) using these coins?
</article>
