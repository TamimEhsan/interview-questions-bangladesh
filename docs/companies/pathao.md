## Initial Interview:

In the initial interview they asked the applicants from their resume, their projects and experience mostly. They are speicifically looking for expertise in `JavaScript` and `React` so they asked some basic concepts like difference between `context` and `state`, difference between `zustand` and `redux`, what is `reducer` function, how `useEffect` hook is used and how does it work.

## Take Home Assessment:

A week after the initial interview, pathao sends an email with proper instruction to build a trello like dashboard with boards,columns and drag-and-drop support. A task should be allowed to add,move edit and delete within the boards. There were bonus points for reordering in the same column, saving across reloads, using OAuth login, unit tests etc. 
- [This](https://github.com/RadifTajwar/Pathao) is the repository of the take home assessment.

## On-site Assessment:

On completing the take home assessment successfully, they asked for an on-site assessment of 5-6 hours in the next week. This time they asked to create an e-commerce dashboard system with basic `CRUD` operations. They asked it to create with `nuxt` js as their existing system is made with `vuejs`. 
- [This](https://github.com/RadifTajwar/pathaoFinal) is the repository of the final assessment.

## Final Interview:

In this round they asked about how the on-site assessment was done. How difficult it was to use a different framework nuxt, as a react/nextjs developer. Asked some questions about graph data structures and algorithms. But most of the qustions of this round were behavioral and non-technical.
