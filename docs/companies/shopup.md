## Introduction
ShopUp is a B2B e-commerce platform connecting small retailers to manufacturers and suppliers, digitizing supply chain. 

## Interview Stages:

These are the steps for the ShopUp Fast track launchpad
1. **Aptitude Test**:	Online aptitude test
2. **SQL Test**:   Online SQL test
3. **In Person Interviews**: One technical and one behavioral in person interview
4. **Final on-site Test and Interview**: Final on-site test short informal interview

## Aptitude Test:

The first round was an
online aptitude test consisting of 23 questions to be solved within 1 hour. The questions covered
topics like pattern matching, profit and interest calculations, and age-related math problems
(e.g., father and children age problems).

## SQL Test:

There were three SQL problems to solve and record a video
explaining the thought process, and submit via a Google Form. Two of the problems were
very challenging—comparable to the "Hard" category on HackerRank.

## In Person Interviews:

### First Interview
<br>
<article>

- During internships, you often face challenging tasks with no existing resources. Have
you faced such a situation in your previous projects? How did you solve it?
- Internship tasks can sometimes be boring or unglamorous. Have you encountered this
before? How did you handle it?
- Internships can present problems outside your knowledge area. Have you experienced
this? How did you deal with it?

### Second Interview
<br>
<article>

- Tell us about yourself.
- In many e-commerce sites, customers provide incorrect addresses. For example, they
list Dinajpur when their actual delivery location is Rangpur. The parcel goes to Dinajpur,
and then the customer says they are in Rangpur. You have 2 minutes to come up with
both technical and non-technical solutions.
- Would you run a business or software company in the future if given the
opportunity?
