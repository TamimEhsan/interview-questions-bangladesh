## Introduction

WellDev Ltd is a software company based in Zurich, Switzerland, specializing in software development and IT services. It has offices in Bangladesh (Dhaka), South Africa, Canada etc.

## Interview Stages

1. **Initial Screening:** After dropping CV they take a MCQ Round, almost every candidate gets an email for participation in this round.
2. **Round 1:** The first round is a technical round and generally lasts for an hour.
3. **Round 2:** The second round is divided into two part. The first part is a behavioural part taken by HR of the company. For the second part two software engineer conducts the technical sessions.
4. **COO Round:** The final round is taken by the COO of the company

## MCQ Round

A Broad Range of Topics

This round consisted of a multiple-choice questionnaire covering these topics. The test required me to share my screen with Quillgo and keep my camera on. It covers wide range of topics like JavaScript fundamentals, OOP, DBMS, SWE principles, Networking, Rest API knowledge, Analytical reasoning, DSA (time complexity, sorting, binary trees, MST, greedy algorithms).

## First Round Questions

Hands-On Problem Solving

<article>

What will the output of this code in C Programming Language and why?

```C
int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};

if(&arr[0] == &arr){
    printf("They are the same!");
}else {
    printf("Not same");
}
```

<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

The name of the array is a pointer to the first item of the Array.
So it will print "They are the same!"

</details>

<article>

Given an array, what will be the base address if we print the array name only (e.g., printf(ara))?
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

It will print the address of the first item of the array.
In C, you can't pass array to functions by "Pass by value".
So when you pass an array to an function (for example: printf(arr)),
the compiler will actually pass the pointer to the first element. 
You can easily test this hypothesis by doing something like this:

```C
int arr[1] = {100};

if(arr == &arr){
    printf("Yay!\n");
}

if(arr == &arr[0]){
    printf("Damn!");
}
```

The above code should print

```bash
Yay!
Damn!
```

What is the time complexity of the print statement?
if it's `O(1)` why is that? Is it the same case for Linked List?
If it's not, why it isn't the same case?
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]

print(arr[2])
```

`Tip:`
Learn about stack and heap memory and their use cases when memory is allocated.
Learn about compile time and runtime memory allocation.

Write a code to delete the middle element of a stack without using any additional data structure while preserving the original order. Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
</article>

<article>

```python
def fn(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    return n + fn(n-1)
```

Given the above function, rename the function according to what the function tries to achive.

`2nd Iteration:`
Write the same function but in a iterative manner.
Does the both implementations have same Time Complexity and Space Complxity?

<details><summary>Show Hint</summary>

Write down the stack trace of the recursive function and try to speak aloud while doing so.
After getting what the function returns, rename the function accordingly.

For the second iterations, a simple loop will be the answer.
However, think deeply about the fundamental difference between the two implementations.
One of the implementation uses a Data structure, one doesn't. So their space complexity won't be same.

What is the time complexity of the following code?

```C
int fun(int n) {
    if(n <= 1) return n;
    int x = fun(n - 1);
    int y = fun(n - 2);
    return x + y;
}

What are the ACID properties in DBMS?
<details><summary>Show Answer</summary>

ACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. Databases that support this are called ACID compliance. The properties are

- **Atomicity:** Each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed.
- **Consistency:** Ensures the databases remain consistent following some predefined business logic both before and after the transaction
- **Isolation:** Each transaction executes in such a way that one is not affected by other s though they were occurring only one.
- **Durability:** The data changes by a successfull transaction is saved even in the event of system failure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Atomicity, isolation and durability are properties of the database, whereas consistency is a property of the application. The C in ACID was tossed in to make the acronym work. [ref: Martin Kleppmann, Designing Data Intensive Applications]
