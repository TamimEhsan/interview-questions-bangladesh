Suppose you want to update value of a field in a database. Generally, a read operation is done to fetch the value. Based on the retrieved value some logic is applies and the result is updated in the field. Example, subtract from balance if the balance is more than some threshold. Another client in the meantime can update the field too thus resulting unexpected behaviour. How can this be solved?

There can be multiple approach to solve this problem.  

1. Complete the whole scenario in one query. 
1. Use stored procedure
1. Use locks. Add an extra column for the purpose of locking. Before fetching a data for update, set the said lock to 1. If it is already 1 then don't proceed.
