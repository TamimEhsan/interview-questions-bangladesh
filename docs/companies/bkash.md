What is concurrency control in databases? Why is it important?
<details> <summary> Show Answer </summary> 

Concurrency control is the mechanism used in database systems to ensure that multiple users or transactions can access and modify the database at the same time (concurrently) without causing data inconsistency, conflicts, or integrity problems.

Without concurrency control, two transactions might update the same data simultaneously, leading to incorrect values. 

Concurrency control avoids problems like lost update (one transaction overwrites another's update), dirty read (reading uncommitted changes from another transaction).

Concurrency control ensures isolation (the ‚ÄúI‚Äù in ACID) by carefully ordering the execution of transactions.

Techniques for concurrency control:
- lock based protocols (e.g., two-phase locking)
- timestamps ordering

What is function overriding in Object-Oriented Programming? How is it different from overloading?

<details> <summary> Show Answer </summary>

Function Overloading in OOP: 
- Function overloading occurs when multiple functions in the same class share the same name but have different parameters list (different type, number, or order of parameters)
- It is decided at compile-time.

Function Overriding in OOP:
- Function overriding occurs when a derived (child) class provides a specific features of a function that is already defined in its base (parent) class.
- The function in the child class must have the same name, parameters, and return type as in the parent class.
- It allows runtime polymorphism (deciding at runtime which version of the function to call)
