**Details:** Participated in an online coding contest.  
**Selection:** Out of numerous participants, around 40-50 were selected for the onsite contest.  

### Onsite Contest
**Selection:** Out of numerous participants, around 10-15 were selected for the final interview.  
**Details:** The onsite contest was held in Sylhet.   

### Final Interview
The final interview is mainly a discussion about the company and the candidate's interest in joining. Employment terms like probabtion periond, internship time, possibility of permanent position, and location were discussed.

## First Round Questions

The given questions are the summarized version of the original questions. The original questions are available in the  [Online Round Problem Set](https://github.com/TamimEhsan/interview-questions-bangladesh/tree/master/docs/resource/appify/Online_Round.pdf).

<article>

Given multiple test cases, each containing a 3-letter string (uppercase/lowercase letters), you have to check whether the string equals "YES", case-insensitively. Output "YES" if it matches, else "NO".
</article>

<article>

Given
- Number of students, games, and connection events
- For each student, the game they like
- A sequence of connections between pairs of students over time

For each game, determine the earliest time when all students who like that game become connected (either directly or indirectly). Output `-1` if they never get connected.
</article>

<article>

Given:
- Number of questions
- For each question: initial score, per-minute penalty, minimum score
- For each question: submission time and number of submissions (positive if solved, non-positive if unsolved)

Calculate the total score based on a formula involving penalties and number of attempts. If a question is unsolved, its score is 0.
</article>

<article>

Given a list of unique 9-digit phone numbers. For each phone number, find the shortest digit substring that uniquely identifies it (i.e., no other number contains it as a substring).
</article>

<article>

Given:
- Number of dishes, adults, and kids
- For each dish: happiness value if eaten by an adult or by a kid

Assign one dish to each person (adult or kid) to maximize the total happiness. An adult eats the entire dish; a kid partially eats it.
</article>

<article>

Given:
- A list of item costs
- A limit on the total increase Sabbir can apply to the item costs

Sabbir increases item costs (total increment â‰¤ limit) to minimize the final score difference in a turn-based game where players pick items alternately and optimally.
</article>

<article>

Given:
- A circular string of length `NÃ—K` representing N fragments of length `K`
- A list of G candidate fragments (all distinct)

Determine if the circular string can be split into a sequence of N valid fragments (from the candidate list) in some rotation. If possible, output any such valid sequence.
</article>

<article>

Given multiple test cases, each with two numbers: total artifacts `n` and a position `k`. Artifacts are arranged in a special sequence: first all odd-numbered ones, then multiples of odd numbers (2Ã—odd, 3Ã—odd, etc.) in order, skipping duplicates. Find which artifact appears at position k.

</article>

<article>

Given grid dimensions `n Ã— m`. Determine if it is possible to assign pigment values to rows and columns such that every cell in the grid (combining row and column pigment modulo nm) has a unique value. If possible, output the row and column pigments.

<article>
 
Given a sequence of integers, convert each number to binary using parity (even â†’ 1, odd â†’ 0), concatenate to form a binary string, and print it with leading zeros removed.
</article>

<article>
 
Given dimensions of two rectangles, one inside another, where the outer rectangle is `(AÃ—B)` and inner rectangle is `(CÃ—D)`, with `C â‰¤ A` and `D â‰¤ B`.

Compute the area between the two rectangles modulo `1,000,000,007`.

<article>
 
Given `N` baskets arranged in a circle with given apples in each and a number `K` indicating how many apples one will eat. 

Simulate the person moving right and eating apples if present, and output the number of apples left in each basket after exactly K apples are eaten.
</article>

<article>

Given a string `s` of length `n`. Pick an integer `k` `(1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ n)` and perform a transformation: reverse each substring of length `k` sliding through the string, and find the lexicographically smallest resulting string. Output that string and the smallest such k.

Given a simple directed graph with `N` vertices and `M` edges. Count how many vertices can be starting points for infinite walks (i.e., they lie on or can reach a cycle).

Given a book with `N` pages (numbered `1` to `N`) and a secret digit (0â€“9), and you randomly pick a page. 
Compute the probability that the page number you picked contains the secret digit, expressed as an irreducible fraction `P/Q`.
