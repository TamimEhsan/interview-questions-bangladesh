# Company Section
This folder is used to add questions for specific companies. Add new companies by creating a new file with .md extension. 

If you want to add multiple files for the same company, then create a folder with the company name and create individual files in it. This can be done to add seperate pages for seperate positions of a company. See `Therap BD` for example.
